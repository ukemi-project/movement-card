        <p class="lead">Movement Card aims to educate and inform all who have interactions with people moving in the
          public domain. Whether that's you, your friends, the security guard, or even a police officer. With a Movement
          Card you have an instant educational resource at your disposal.</p>
        <p class="lead">The movement card is part resource, part research and part response - created to promote freedom
          of movement.</p>
        <p class="lead">It is a worldwide project started in Scotland through a collaboration between

              <h3 class="h4 mb-4">Concept</h3>
              <p>In 2014 Ukemi co-founder David Banks first conceptualised the Movement Card as part of the Many
                Movements collective. With fellow member Paul Sayer working on the design, Gordon Tsang handling the
                legal language and John Hall providing proofreading.</p>
              <p>The aim was to create a handy pocket-sized card
                that details a few basics regarding your right to practice parkour in Scotland.

            <div class="timeline-item">
              <h3 class="h4 mb-4">Release</h3>
              <p>Having tested the concept locally, Ukemi adopted the project in colaboration with Parkour Outreach in
                2019. This adoption included a complete rebranding by Daniel Smith, a review of the laws, and a
                dedicated website that provides greater detail than the card.</p>

              <h3 class="h4 mb-4">Expansion</h3>
              <p>Seeing success in launching the card in Scotland, the project attracted international interest leading
                to a partnership with parkour governing bodies Parkour Earth and ParkourUK to bring the card to other
                countries.</p>
              <p>So far, we have Scotland, Finland, New Zealand, and England involved. We would love to have more, so
                get in touch with us if you think you could help bring it to your country!</p>
