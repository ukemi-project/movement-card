Your freedom to move should equal your freedom to speak!
Clean, Simple & Elegant

The movement card is part resource, part research and part response action created to promote freedom of movement. It is a worldwide project started in Scotland through a collaboration between Ukemi Project and Parkour Outreach.

Our goal is to have an option for as many locations as possible and we would love to hear from you if you have the knowledge or means to contribute!
